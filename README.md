# TWITCH CODE JAM - TimeEnjoyed

- This is supposed to be a typing racer for the twitch community, where chat can join in an race, with a leaderboard at the end
- Unfortunately due to time constraints, its just a plain old typing test
- So enjoy an app which requires you to login for no reason xD

- Built using nextJs and nextAuth
- Deployed version, cuz idk how you'd download and demo without the auth-id/secret
